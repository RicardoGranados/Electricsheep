    "Ok by now if you are old enough, like me, to have seen this movie, you will have remembered one of the best movies ever, also the saddest. A movie where the names of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas appear and make it a really nice dinosaur movie. But one of the true reasons that this movie has to be incredible is that James Horner was in charge of the Soundtrack [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_Before_Time#Soundtrack)].\n",
    "If you didn't knew, The 'longneck' called Littlefoot, was an apatosaurus. Apatosaurus means \"deceptive lizard\". This dinosaur received also the name of Bronotsaurus. \n",

    "The paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh, discovered the fossils of a dinosaur which he named *Apatosaurus Ajax* in 1877. After that he discovered a new fossil larger and more complete, which he called the *Brontosaurus Excelsus*. Here is when this name began to spread, for example the pet of **Fred Flinstone** was a Brontosaurus. But then a review of this fossils revealed that the differences were not enough to consider two different genus.\n",
    "Nowadays there are still different opinions if this differences are sufficient to consider to keep the name Brontosaurus [[2](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/brontosaurus-name-resurrected-new-dino-family-tree)].\n",
